This study proposes the PIXAR (Path-based Informative and eXplainAble Recommendation) framework, which enhances the explainability of recommendation results by utilizing paths in knowledge graphs as inputs for LLMs. PIXAR is composed of three stages: (1) Meaningful path exploration through Collaborative Beam Search, (2) Information Compression, and (3) Explanation generation based on LLM. Experimental results show that PIXAR outperforms the existing LLM-based recommendation framework, LLMXRec, in terms of both performance and explainability by leveraging path information. Particularly, the Information Compression module enabled the LLM to better understand the path information and enhance recommendation explanations. This study empirically demonstrates the explainability of path-based methods proposed in previous research and suggests a new direction for recommendation systems utilizing knowledge graphs and LLMs.
